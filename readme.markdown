Pippi is in the process of moving from a Pure Data / python hybrid system to 
a pure python system powered by Fabric. I'll probably move it into a new repo 
eventually but for now, excuse the mess!

Check out console.py, dsp.py, and the generator scripts in the orc directory 
for more. More about my Fabric system at http://fabric-dsp.com

Requires at least python 2.7, and the pygame module for i/o.
